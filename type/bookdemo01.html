	<h1>Chapter 4. The Centralized Partnership</h1>
	<p>
		Corporate organization structures are often employed without intentionality. People use what’s <strong>for them in the past</strong>, typically some form of hierarchical bureaucracy, broken up into functional departments. Design teams embed themselves in these structures, modeling themselves on the other functional departments.
	</p>
	<p>
		These structures, though, are products of 19th- and 20th-century industrial thinking.<sup><a href="">[13]</a></sup> Design, which has emerged as a primary discipline because of 21st-century concerns of connected software and services, <strong><em>be stymied if it simply conforms to these outdated practices</em></strong>. To realize design’s potential, design leaders must be thoughtful and intentional about how the design organization is structured and shaped.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		What I came to realize is that in order to deliver great user experiences, we need to get the organization right. We need to spend a lot of time thinking about people and their relationships within the design team, and then their relationships with other teams. How you shape people and their relationships is necessary in order to get great experiences out into the world.

	<h2>Organizational Models for Design Teams</h2>
	<p>
		When the design team is small, say just five members, its organizational model is straightforward—it’s the design team. The team is focused on a couple of key projects, and doesn’t have to think too hard about how to tackle them—at that size, just do what feels right.
	</p>
	<p>
		As the team grows, <em>if something isn’t done about this structure,</em> everyone will report to one boss, and there will be one undifferentiated mass of designers trying to work together. That is not sustainable. The design team must evolve into a design organization, with explicit consideration around structure, project work, and cross-functional collaboration. Historically, there have been two ways that design organizations have typically operated: either as centralized internal services, or decentralized and embedded. Each has benefits and drawbacks, which we’ll explore in some detail. We’ll then introduce a third way, what we call the Centralized Partnership. Though unorthodox, it potentially leads the way for thinking about how functional teams (not just design!) should be structured to tackle 21st-century challenges.
	</p>
	<h3>Centralized Internal Services</h3>
	<p>
		Given that most companies’ initial experience with design is by working with an external design agency, <cite>Michael Cina</cite> said, <q>It’s not surprising that when they first started building in-house design teams, the common organizational model was a centralized internal services firm, operating essentially as an in-house agency.</q>
	</p>
	<p>
		In the agency model, the organization is led by a director (who may have a design background, or may just be a professional manager tasked with overseeing the operations of the design team) who oversees a series of teams organized by functions such as interaction design, information architecture, visual design, usability, and project management. Each team is led by a manager, whose qualification was that they were the most senior practitioner of that particular function. These in-house agencies are typically placed inside a marketing organization (if the website was seen primarily as a marketing vehicle), an IT organization (because the Web was delivered on computers), or a newly created “digital” or “ecommerce” team.
	</p>
	<p>
		This internal services group is seen as a pool of talent upon which to draw as needed by projects. Someone from “the business” (a product group, or a line of business, or marketing), would reach out to the director with a request for design work. Often this takes the shape of a creative brief that makes clear what is needed and in what time frame.
	</p>
	<p>
		After some back and forth between the director and business representative, a project plan is settled upon, and the director then works with an internal resourcing manager to figure out who is available from which functional teams, and assigns them to do the work. That team tackles the problem in the given time frame (as varied as two days to two months to two years), and when the project is finished, the designers return to the pool, waiting for their next assignment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Many companies go so far as to literally treat their internal design team as if it were an external firm, where the business unit requesting design pays chargebacks to the internal team, and where the business may opt to work with a design agency if it found it a preferable relationship.
	</p>
	<h4>Benefits of centralization</h4>
	<p>
		This form of centralization is so out of favor, it can be hard to remember why anyone would operate this way. That said, it’s worth recognizing that it offers some very real benefits:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Supports an internal design community and culture</li>
		<li>Provides clear lines of authority and control</li>
		<li>Allows designers to work on a range of projects</li>
		<li>Encourages a consistent user experience</li>
		<li>Create efficiencies in doing the work</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		From the perspective of the design team, the strongest benefit of centralization is how it supports the development of a design community. An internal services team, operating as an in-house agency, can replicate the focus and commitment of a design firm. This encourages the emergence of a strong design culture, as designers spend much of their time interacting and learning from one another. Designers have a clear sense of how they can grow their skills, and their careers. They have managers who can serve as mentors.
	</p>
	<p>
		That straightforwardness in the centralized design team structure also provides clear lines of authority and control. For design direction and approval, there are no questions, as vision setting and decision making resides with the senior-most members of the team. This helps the designers focus on their work, because they don’t need to worry about conflicting feedback. If there are issues or concerns, escalation paths are clear.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also similar to an external firm, another benefit for designers is that they work on a wide range of projects, with different parts of the business, and of varying length and scale. This exposure broadens their understanding of how to apply design, and the variety keeps them engaged.
	</p>
	<p>
		The clearest benefit for customers is that this approach encourages consistency across the company’s designed experiences. A centralized team establishes design guidelines, and enforces them through the projects they take on. A customer knows what to expect regardless of which part of the company he is engaging with.
	</p>
	<p>
		For the design team, these guidelines also lead to efficiencies in their work product. Once you solve a design problem for one part of the business, if another part of the business poses a similar problem, it’s speedier to solve. The design team achieves quicker turnaround times on such repetitious challenges, and should be able to focus their effort on harder novel problems.
	</p>
	<p>
		The finance department realizes the biggest benefit of centralization. By having all the designers on one team, there is no risk of redundant roles throughout the organization, keeping headcount costs down.
	</p>
	<p>
		Related to that, if the centralized team uses chargebacks, it’s very clear that design is something you pay for, not just some assumed utility like phone calls or printer paper. If a part of the business wants design, they need a good justification, and that will make them more serious about it.
	</p>
	<h4>Drawbacks of centralization</h4>
	<p>
		While centralization makes a lot of abstract business sense, when it comes to day-to-day practice, it proves problematic for the following reasons:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Disempowerment and lack of ownership</li>
		<li>“Us versus them” attitude</li>
		<li>Lack of clarity around priority and timing</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The gravest issue for designers is that they find themselves fundamentally disempowered. By the time designers are brought in to the project, the important decisions have already been made. Their concerns about assumptions underlying a brief are easily dismissed, because those designers will be gone when their part of the work is over. It’s the people in the business who are held accountable, and with that accountability comes authority.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design may be seen only as aesthetics and styling, or as one former client referred to it, “SUAC: Shut Up and Color.” God forbid you actually conduct any usability studies, because any issues found will probably not get addressed, as designs need to be handed to the engineers at a specified time in order to meet the predetermined ship date.
	</p>
	<p>
		This disempowerment leads to designers developing an “us versus them” attitude. They become disenchanted, nodding during meetings, but rolling their eyes afterward at the requirements they’ve been handed. They put in the bare minimum to get the work done, because their effort isn’t going to be appreciated. And such attitude and behavior only reinforces the business’s treatment of designers, leading to a vicious cycle of diminished expectations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The business units requesting design get frustrated because they have no real control over this function. They have pressing and important needs, but they have to wait for the design organization to be able to staff a team. Other projects are given priority, and they don’t understand why. When they finally do get design resources, the deadlines are such that there’s not enough time for any creativity. They have to wait for internal design team reviews before work gets approved. And so the business feels that they had to wait a long time, only to get substandard work.
	</p>
	<p>
		After this happens enough times, business units (or product teams) agitate for change. They want total control over what they produce.
	</p>
	<h3>Decentralized and Embedded</h3>
	<p>
		When a company realizes that its centralized, function-based organization is leading to delays, subpar work, and unsatisfying outcomes, a common solution is to reorganize into wholly staffed, independent teams, with all the capabilities necessary for delivery. This reduces overhead by giving these teams autonomy to make decisions that benefit themselves, with the expectation that if everyone is looking out for their best interests, that will bubble up and serve the interests of the company as a whole.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design teams follow suit. Instead of a single design organization, designers embed within these decentralized teams. In technical organizations with decentralized product teams, one or two designers are grouped with a product manager and team of engineers <a href="">(Figure 4-1)</a>. In more traditional organizations that are organized by business units (for instance, a bank that has units for checking and savings, loans, credit cards, and small business) teams are formed within those units. These teams have their own designer headcount, and fill the roles as they see fit. Designers work much more closely with business people and engineers, figuratively and literally.
